## What is Raster?

Raster is a Javascript library that makes use of Dynamic-HTML to 
implement desktop-like GUI controls in a web browser.

This library is intended for making corporate intranet applications with interfaces 
requiring dynamic UI controls that can display dense amounts of data records such 
as front-ends for database administration, report queries, product and server 
configuration web consoles, etc.

The UI controls in raster are not optimal for developing interfaces aimed at
mobile phones and tablets, but rather meant for use in desktop computer web
browsers applications.


## Which browsers Raster supports?

Pretty much any modern web browser. Raster has been tested in:

- Firefox 3+
- Chrome 10+
- Safari 5.0+ (Windows)
- Opera 11+
- Electron
- Embedded-Mozilla for SWT3.6/XULRunner 1.9

- Internet Explorer *6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and Edge (Standards mode)
  Note: In IE6, Raster make use of css expressions. IE6 is functional, but slow.

- Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8 (Quirks mode)
  Note: Raster works in IE quirks-mode, but due to the use of CSS expressions, it will be 
  slower that using IE in standards mode.


## What UI controls Raster implements?

- Dialog
- Graphics Panel (Canvas/VML proxy)
- List (basic, grid, table, and thumbnail images)
- Menus
- Splitter
- Tabs
- Toolbars
- Tree

## Getting Started
   
The best way to get started is by downloading the project as a ZIP archive, 
extract it to a temp folder, and opening the *.html files on the [/examples](http://www.lopezworks.info/raster/docs/examples.html) 
folder using a browser. These files show how the basic UI controls are used; 
after that you can use the [Online Reference](http://www.lopezworks.info/raster/docs/index.html) 
to find out more details on any given method and its parameters.
 
 
## Archive Status

Raster is no longer under active development. If you find it useful, by all means, use it.
