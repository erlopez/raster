## What is Raster?

Raster is a Javascript library that makes use of Dynamic-HTML to 
implement desktop-like GUI controls in a web browser.

This library is intended for making corporate intranet applications with interfaces 
requiring dynamic UI controls that can display dense amounts of data records such 
as front-ends for database administration, report queries, product and server 
configuration web consoles, etc.


## Which browsers Raster supports?

Pretty much any modern web browser. Raster has been tested in:

- Firefox 3+
- Chrome 10+
- Safari 5.0+ (Windows)
- Opera 11+
- Electron
- Embedded-Mozilla for SWT3.6/XULRunner 1.9

- Internet Explorer *6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and Edge (Standards mode)
  Note: In IE6, Raster make use of css expressions. IE6 is functional, but slow.

- Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8 (Quirks mode)
  Note: Raster works in IE quirks-mode, but due to the use of CSS expressions, it will be 
  slower that using IE in standards mode.


## What UI controls Raster implements?

- Dialog
- Graphics Panel (Canvas/VML proxy)
- List (basic, grid, table, and thumbnail images)
- Menus
- Splitter
- Tabs
- Toolbars
- Tree

## Getting Started
   
The best way to get started is by downloading the project as a ZIP archive, 
extract it to a temp folder, and opening the *.html files on the [/examples](http://www.lopezworks.info/raster/docs/examples.html) 
folder using a browser. These files show how the basic UI controls are used; 
after that you can use the [Online Reference](http://www.lopezworks.info/raster/docs/index.html) 
to find out more details on any given method and its parameters.
